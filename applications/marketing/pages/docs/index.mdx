Documentation coming soon! This is a placeholder page to demonstrate the Nextra integration.

### Quick Start

# Install Soul Player (example - not yet available)
cargo install soul-player

# Run desktop app
soul-player
```

### Server Setup

```bash
# Start the server
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/music:/music \
  soul-player/server

## Architecture

Soul Player uses a trait-based architecture that allows the same core logic to run across all platforms.

```rust
// Simplified example
pub trait AudioOutput {
    fn play(&mut self, buffer: &AudioBuffer) -> Result<()>;
}

// Platform-specific implementations
impl AudioOutput for CpalOutput { ... }
impl AudioOutput for ESP32Output { ... }
```
