//! Application services (business logic)
//!
//! This module contains high-level application logic that coordinates
//! between different hardware drivers:
//! - Playback service (state machine, queue management)
//! - UI service (navigation, menu rendering)
//! - Library service (database integration)
//! - Sync service (Bluetooth sync protocol)

// Submodules will be added as services are implemented:
// pub mod playback;
// pub mod ui;
// pub mod library;
// pub mod sync;
